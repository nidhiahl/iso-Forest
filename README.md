# iso-Forest
A c++ implementation of isolation forest.
data.h and data.cpp are the data preparation files, reads from a data file and create the input ready for iForest construction.
iforest.h and iforest.cpp, itree.h and itree.cpp, treenode.h and treenode.cpp consists of components for isoaltion forest creation and anomaly detection application.
main.cpp is the driver cpp file that run the end to end algorithm from dataPreparation to Anomaly score computation and writing anomaly score to file.
